knob-fitting.scad, oven-fitting-bottom.scad and oven-fitting-top.scad are files that must be rendered with OpenSCAD and printed with a 3D printer. 
oven-fitting.scad is the two sides of oven-fitting-bottom.scad and oven-fitting-top.scad combined. The geometry of oven-fitting alone is more complex to print as one piece and requires high amounts of bridging, which is an ineffective use of extruding material. 
variables.scad contains a list of variables used by all .scad files, it has no renderable forms.
