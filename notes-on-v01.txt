- The servos were underpowered and unreliable towards their outer reach <45 degrees and >135 degrees, I would like to get better servos with better reliability and more power. 
- The voltage regulator circuit was liable to overheating. It overheated so much that in a 90 degree shift of the Off/Bake knob it could no longer provide the power to push the knob back to its original state. The regulator should be redesigned. 
- There should be a way for the Arduino to cut power to the servos and there should be a way to know which direction the servos are pointed in before delivering power. 
- Encryption needs to be added to the product
